## Contribution rules
Good way to start is to fix one of the existing issue OR add a new issue ( if it's already not there ). Performance and number of offsets required to implement a feature is very important to me so due to this reason your MR might be rejected or asked to be modified. If your MR or idea is rejected feel free to fork this tool and do whatever you want.
